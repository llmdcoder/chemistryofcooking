			<h2> Chemistry and Cakes</h2>
			<h3> What actually happens when you bake a cake? </h3>
			<p><bold> Baking is essentially a bunch of chemical reactions that relies on the interactions of various chemicals present in flour, sugar and other ingredidents.</bold>
			Baking a cake is an endothermic reaction; the cake dough isn't really a cake, but when it's heated in the oven, a chemical reaction occurs and new bonds are formed changing <em>ooey-gooey</em> batter into a <u>fluffy, light, delicious treat</u>!
